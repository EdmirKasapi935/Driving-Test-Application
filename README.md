# Driving-Test-Application</br>
The aim and scope of this project is to create an application similar to the ones used in driving schools to test the candidates for driving license tests. It is important to note that this project is not intended for real world use. However, it can act as a prototype to see and understand the logic on how such apps may function. It was also an opportunity for me to expand my set of skills and general understanding of programming.<br/>
