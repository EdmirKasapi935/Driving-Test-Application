# Driving-Test-Application
The aim and scope of this project is to create an application similar to the ones used in driving schools to test the candidates for driving license tests. It is important to note that this project is not intended for real world use. However, it can act as a prototype to see and understand the logic on how such apps may function. It was also an opportunity for me to expand my set of skills and general understanding of programming.<br/>

# Features
-- Simple user login and registration through name and surname. (No passwords, they can easily be implemented later at a request).</br>
-- Driving exams for 3 vehicle categories as well as behavioral exams.<br/>
-- Dynamic test interface and timer. The tests are evaluated and recorded for later review.<br/>
-- Secure quersies and overall protection against SQL injections.<br>

# Setup
The setup procedure for the project/application is very simple. Since it runs on web, you will need to hve at least one browser installed on your computer. You will also need a code editor like Visual Studio Code as well as having the PHP language installed (You can use XAMPP for that). Open the project using VSCode, open a console at the project folder there and type this command "php -S localhost:1234", then ctrl+click the link generated by this command and the project will be running on your default browser. If you insist on using XAMPP, move all the files into the htdocs folder of XAMPP and activate the Apache server. Keep in mind, this app uses SQLite for the database services and the databse will not appear on XAMPP's PHPMyAdmin, since it runs on MySQL. In order to access the database and the data stored within, you can use DBBrowser for SQLIte.</br>
